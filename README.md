# GE_DataAnalytics_VE
General Electronics offered a Virtual Internship program via Forage in 2022. This repository holds the dataset provided in this challenge and how I solved the tasks. 
The dataset is on GE aviation data. It contains information on aviation engine parts. Two tasks were assigned in this program :
# Module 1 : Changing the temperature format for one dataset of an airline and then combining the datasets of 4 airlines together making a new sheet. This required thorough understanding of data manipulation using MS Excel.
# Module 2 : This task required use of Tableau. The second task was to make a dashboard vizualizing how each engine part was performing. 
             Key Characteristic measurements of each engine part and their maximum and minimum permissible values were given. Together it is known as pn-op-kc feature of a manufactured part
             We had to visualize if the recorded measurements fell within the permissible range. 
             
# Bonus Task : The bonus task was to make a geographical mapping of the destination locations where GE airlines have flown to.
